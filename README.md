Introduction

This project serves as a practical illustration of how sensitive data can be protected using cryptography. 
Users can investigate an extensive range of cryptographic algorithms from simple classical ciphers to powerful hashing
and key exchange techniques through an interactive and intuitive interface. By enabling text and file encryption, 
decryption, and hashing, the system gives the ideas an actual and useful form. By using these tools, users can learn more about 
the important part that encryption plays in protecting data integrity, ensuring privacy, and facilitating safe online communication.

Project Objectives:

Show Off How to Use Cryptography Practically
Provide a practical example of how cryptographic methods can be used to protect private information in practical settings.

Examine Different Kinds of Cryptographic Techniques
Give users the opportunity to test out both traditional and contemporary cryptographic techniques, such as hashing functions, 
key exchange protocols, and symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

Improve Knowledge Through Engagement
Provide a user-friendly, interactive interface to help users in understanding the fundamentals of hashing, encryption, and decryption.

Assistance with File and Text Security Functions
Give users the ability to encrypt, decode, and hash files and text in order to resemble real-world data protection scenarios.

Raise Awareness of Data Integrity and Privacy
Emphasize how crucial encryption is to maintaining data integrity, protecting confidentiality, and facilitating safe online communication.

Promote experimental and educational learning
Offer a learning resource appropriate for students, instructors, and individuals with an interest in cryptography and cybersecurity
